<title>Cookie Clicker's Modding API</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>MODDING API</h1>

- (NOTE: this functions a little differently in the standalone/Steam version; have a look in the game's /mods folder for example mods - though most of the information below still applies)

- Have your mod call Game.registerMod("unique id", mod object)

- The "unique id" value is a string the mod will use to index and retrieve its save data; special characters are ignore

- The "mod object" value is an object structured like so:
<div id="code">{
  init:function(){
    //this function is called as soon as the mod is registered
    //declare hooks here
  },
  save:function(){
    //use this to store persistent data associated with your mod
    return 'a string to be saved';
  },
  load:function(str){
    //do stuff with the string data you saved previously
  },
}</div>

- The mod object may also contain any other data or functions you want, for instance to make them accessible to other mods

- Your mod and its data can be accessed with Game.mods['mod id']

- Hooks are functions the game calls automatically in certain circumstances, like when calculating cookies per click or when redrawing the screen

- To add a hook: Game.registerHook('hook id', yourFunctionHere) - note: you can also declare whole arrays of hooks, ie. Game.registerHook('hook id',[function1,function2,...])

- To remove a hook: Game.removeHook('hook id', theSameFunctionHere)

- Some hooks are fed a parameter you can use in the function

- List of valid hook ids:
<span id="code">logic</span>- called every logic tick

<span id="code">draw</span>- called every draw tick

<span id="code">reset</span>- called whenever the player resets; parameter is true if this is a hard reset, false if it's an ascension

<span id="code">reincarnate</span>- called when the player has reincarnated after an ascension

<span id="code">ticker</span>- called when determining news ticker text; should return an array of possible choices to add

<span id="code">cps</span>- called when determining the CpS; parameter is the current CpS; should return the modified CpS

<span id="code">cookiesPerClick</span>- called when determining the cookies per click; parameter is the current value; should return the modified value

<span id="code">click</span>- called when the big cookie is clicked

<span id="code">create</span>- called after the game declares all buildings, buffs, upgrades and achievs; use this to declare your own - note that while the game distinguishes between vanilla and non-vanilla content, saving/loading functionality for custom content (including stuff like active buffs or permanent upgrade slotting) is not explicitly implemented and may be unpredictable and broken

<span id="code">check</span>- called every few seconds when we check for upgrade/achiev unlock conditions; you can also use this for other checks that you don't need happening every logic frame

- Function hooks are provided for convenience and more advanced mod functionality will probably involve manual code injection

- Please be mindful of the length of the data you save, as it does inflate the export-save-to-string feature

NOTE: modding API is susceptible to change and may not always function super-well

- Example mod structure:
<div id="code">Game.registerMod("unique id", {
  init:function(){
    //this function is called as soon as the mod is registered
    //declare hooks here
  },
  save:function(){
    //use this to store persistent data associated with your mod
    return 'a string to be saved';
  },
  load:function(str){
    //do stuff with the string data you saved previously
  },
})</div>

- Example mod injector:
<div id="code">(function(){Game.LoadMod('https://Your GitHub Name.github.io/Your GitHub Repo Name/Mod Filename')})()</div>
